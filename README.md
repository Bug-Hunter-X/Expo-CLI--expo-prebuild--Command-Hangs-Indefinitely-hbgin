# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Command Hangs Indefinitely

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command hangs indefinitely without providing any error messages or progress updates.  The issue appears to be related to the CLI's interaction with the underlying build process and not directly tied to application code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.
4. Observe that the command hangs indefinitely.

## Solution

The provided solution explores alternative approaches to prebuild the app, including cleaning the project's cache and attempting a different build method.  Further investigation into the root cause may involve checking the Expo CLI logs or system resource usage during the prebuild process.

## Additional Notes

This bug appears to be non-deterministic and may not manifest consistently across different environments or Expo versions. The provided solution offers a workaround, and the root cause of the issue requires further investigation.
