While the precise root cause of the hanging `expo prebuild` command is difficult to pinpoint without more specific error logs or environment details, the following steps may resolve the issue:

**1. Clean the project cache:**

   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean
   ```

   This command forces Expo CLI to clear any existing build artifacts or cached data that might be interfering with the build process.  This often resolves transient issues.

**2. Try building directly via EAS Build:**

   Consider bypassing the local `expo prebuild` command and using EAS Build directly. This often provides a more stable and consistent build process by utilizing a cloud-based infrastructure. Refer to the EAS Build documentation for instructions: [https://docs.expo.dev/build/](https://docs.expo.dev/build/)

**3. Check Expo CLI Logs and System Resources:**

If the issue persists, investigate more deeply by monitoring the Expo CLI's logs (often found in a system's log files) for any hints of underlying errors.  Additionally, observe system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to see if there are any bottlenecks affecting the build process.
